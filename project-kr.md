## Project description:

The project will consist of two parts:

### A theoretical part in which you should review the most used techniques in
Representation of Knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence. As a guide in this section you can follow the article [1]
What is Knowledge Representation in AI? Techniques You Need To Know or a similar article that you can find [2]. Once done
the revision of the techniques you must write a document with a maximum of 5 pages with a brief explanation of each
technique in which you must include a Bibliography section with references to the documents consulted. It will be valued
the originality of the work,
clarity of explanations, examples used and quality of wording and additional elements used
(graphics, videos, etc.) 

Alternatively, you can agree with the teacher on a different job than the revision of the techniques for Knowledge Representation in artificial intelligence.

### A practical part in which you must choose a project to carry out in Prolog. You can find some ideas in
Markus Triska's website [3] or in P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems [4] for example. Possible exercises are not limited
to those who appear on these pages. After carrying out the implementation you must write a document of no more than 5 pages where
The operation of the program carried out, the difficulties encountered and how they have been solved are explained. It will be valued
the originality of the work, the clarity in the explanations and the correct operation of the program.

Two deliveries will be made:

### The first, (enters mid-project) at the end of May on a date to be specified. In this installment, preliminary versions of both theoretical and practical work must be presented.
    
### The second on the official date of the Knowledge Representation exam. On this second date, the final documents of the theoretical part and the practical part must be delivered.
